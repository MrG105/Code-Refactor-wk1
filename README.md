## Homework Week 1: Code Refactor
===

## Description
This project consists of a refactoring of the original code for a webpage for Horiseon.  Code refactoring includes adding semantic elements to both the html and css page,
as well as grouping together elements in the css page.  Comments have been added to indicate different sections for easy navigation in the future.  Links have been updated
to work correctly and link to the relevant sections of the page.

## Screenshot
Here you can find a mockup screenshot of the webpage, displaying the heading bar and the first article image
